# Getting to the Venue

[C3 Convention Centre](https://c3conventioncentre.com.au/)

64 Anglesea St, South Hobart TAS 7004

## Walk

Hobart's topography offers a mix of gentle and steep gradients, depending on where you're walking. The flatter waterfront and CBD areas are more accessible for casual walking, while heading west or into the suburbs can become more challenging due to the city's hillside layout. The views, however, often reward the effort, with sweeping vistas of the river, the harbor, and the distant mountain.

The venue is located on the [Hobart Rivulet](https://www.greaterhobarttrails.com.au/tracks/hobart-rivulet-park), a gentle 2.7km walk west from the CBD to Cascade Brewery. You may even see a platypus along the way who recently starred in the document [The Platypus Guardian](https://iview.abc.net.au/show/platypus-guardian).

## Public Transport

Buses are your friend in Hobart and the trip takes about 12 minutes from the Hobart CBD.
