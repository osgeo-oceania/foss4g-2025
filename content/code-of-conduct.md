# Code of Conduct

FOSS4G SotM Oceania 2024 has adopted the [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org/), all who attend our events or participate on our mailing list are expected to have read this document, and to behave accordingly.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you believe someone is breaking this code of conduct, you may reply to them, and point to this code of conduct. Such messages may be in public or in private, whatever is most appropriate. Assume good faith; it is more likely that participants are unaware of their bad behaviour than that they intentionally try to degrade the quality of the discussion. Should there be difficulties in dealing with the situation, you may report your concerns to event staff, a conference committee member or the OSGeo Oceania Board. Serious or persistent offenders may be expelled from the event or forum by event organizers or forum leaders.

## Contact Information

You can email the FOSS4G Oceania organizing team with any concerns at [chair@foss4g-oceania.org](mailto:chair@foss4g-oceania.org).
