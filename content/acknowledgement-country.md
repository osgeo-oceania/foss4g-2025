FOSS4G SotM Oceania 2024 is taking place in nipaluna, lutruwita – now known as Hobart, Tasmania.

In recognition of the deep history and culture of this Island, we would like to acknowledge the Muwinina people, the traditional owners of the Land upon which we gather. We acknowledge and pay our respects to all Tasmanian Aboriginal Communities; all of whom have survived invasion and dispossession, and continue to maintain their identity and culture.

_lutruwita milaythina Pakana_ – Tasmania is Aboriginal land.
