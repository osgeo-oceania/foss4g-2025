FOSS4G 2025 is taking place in Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland, Aotearoa New Zealand.

These are the Māori names given to Auckland. They speak of our diverse landscapes, beautiful harbours, and fertile soils. They speak of the coming together of different iwi (tribes) to meet and trade.

  Tēnā koutou katoa — Greetings to you all
</span>

In the spirit of manaakitanga — hospitality, generosity, and openness of spirit — we welcome our visitors as guests. We are dedicated to providing an inclusive, safe and inspiring environment for the FOSS4G community to collaborate, learn, and share.
