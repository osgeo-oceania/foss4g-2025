## What's in it for you?

Bragging rights, of course! Your logo will represent FOSS4G 2025 across digital and print platforms, conference swag, and beyond. Plus, you'll gain the admiration of mappers, coders, and geospatial enthusiasts from all corners of the globe.

## Design Brief

Your design should embody the spirit of FOSS4G 2025 while meeting the following guidelines:
Must-Haves

- **OSGeo/FOSS4G Ribbon**: Incorporate elements of the iconic "ribbon" [used in past FOSS4G conference logos](http://foss4g.org/) ([Download](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/File:FOSS4G_ribbon.pdf))
- **Oceania & New Zealand Themes**: Reflect the region and host country in your design
- **T-Shirt Friendly**: Use a minimal color palette to ensure low-cost, high-quality printing
- **Versatility**: The design should work well on both light and dark backgrounds (or include versions for each)
- **File Formats**: Submit your logo in PNG and a scalable format like SVG or PDF
- **Originality**: Ensure your design stands out from logos of other mapping conferences (e.g., Where 2.0, ESRI, SOTM)
- **Neutrality**: Avoid references to sponsor brands, related companies, or copyrighted material that isn't yours

### Optional Enhancements

### Your Design Should Communicate

- Geospatial/mapping concepts
- The potential of open-source geospatial tools

- Intelligence and trustworthiness
- The spirit of a global movement

Let your design tell a story of innovation, collaboration, and inclusivity - one that resonates with our vibrant geospatial community!
