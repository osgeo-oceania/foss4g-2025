# Travelling to New Zealand

If you are a **New Zealand or Australian citizen**, you do **not need a visa** to enter New Zealand.

Many people can use a **New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA)** to enter New Zealand
without applying for a visa first. This depends on:

- Your **passport**
- How you are **travelling**
- Whether you are **visiting** or only **transiting**

For further information and a list of eligible countries, visit:  
[New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA)](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/visas/new-zealand-electronic-travel-authority-nzeta/)  
**Cost**: NZ$17

## Australian Permanent Residents

If you are an **Australian permanent resident**, you **must have an NZeTA** before you travel
to New Zealand. You must show **evidence at check-in** that you have:

- An **Australian permanent resident visa** or an **Australian resident return visa** in the passport you are travelling on
- **Travel conditions** on the visa allowing you to return to Australia.

## Other Nationalities

If you are **not a New Zealand or Australian citizen** and **not eligible for a NZeTA**, you will need to apply
for a **New Zealand visitor visa**.
