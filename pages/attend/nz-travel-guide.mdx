New Zealand has no state religion or established church and freedom of religion has been protected since the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840.

Auckland is a vibrant tapestry of cultures, boasting the largest Polynesian population in the world.

## LGBTQIA+ Laws

New Zealand is a socially progressive country with a reputation for making many different types of people feel at home, and is often called one of the most LGBTQIA+ friendly countries in the world.

In 2004 New Zealand instituted civil union (for both same-sex and opposite sex couples), and in 2013 same-sex marriage was legalised. Child adoption by same-sex couples was also legalised in 2013. Auckland has been rated alongside Toronto, San Francisco and London as one of the top gay-friendly cities in the world, with a remarkable pride festival held every year.
