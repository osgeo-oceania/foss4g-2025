## About the TGP

It is funded by OSGeo Oceania, OSGeo Foundation, proceeds from our generous sponsors, and contributions from organisations and individuals. Please note that the number of grants available is dependent on this funding and the number of applications we receive.

The TGP is managed by the FOSS4G 2025 LOC Committee, in collaboration with the OSGeo Oceania Board. For more information, either on the disbursement of grants or guidance on the application process, please email us at tgp@foss4g.org and we will do our best to assist and accommodate you.
