# Welcome to the South Pacific

OSGeo Oceania invites the FOSS4G community to Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland, the City of Sails, largest city of Aotearoa New Zealand for FOSS4G 2025.

<span className="font-display italic">
  Tāmaki Makaurau — A place desired by many.
</span>
<span className="font-display italic">
  Tāmaki Herenga Waka — The place where many canoes gather
</span>

These are the Māori names given to Auckland. They speak of our diverse landscapes, beautiful harbours, and fertile soils. They speak of the coming together of different iwi (tribes) to meet and trade.

<span className="font-display italic">
  Tēnā koutou katoa — Greetings to you all
</span>

In the spirit of manaakitanga — hospitality, generosity, and openness of spirit — we welcome our visitors as guests. We are dedicated to providing an inclusive, safe and inspiring environment for the FOSS4G community to collaborate, learn, and share.
