With your help, we are building a dynamic gathering that fosters collaboration and celebrates innovation in the exciting world of Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial.

We have committed to openness and inclusion and are **thrilled to see papers, lightning talks, workshops, and more coming in from all over**; we encourage you to *keep them coming!*

Our Pacific family warmly welcomes you and are truly excited to have this opportunity to share our place with the global FOSS4G community. Let's work together to make FOSS4G 2025 in Auckland a landmark event, let's make this the most diverse congress yet.
