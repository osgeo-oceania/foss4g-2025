At work, she plays at the intersection of geospatial technology and climate resilience, focusing on remote sensing, blue carbon ecosystems, and disaster risk reduction in the Pacific. Her background includes everything from writing adaptation concept notes and slum upgrading strategies to leading user engagement for digital Earth platforms; a love of using GIS and storytelling to bring technical work to life and make it accessible for communities and decision-makers alike. Outside of work, you’ll find her lost in fantasy romance novels, experimenting in the kitchen, or planning her next escape. Kamsin has been part of the FOSS4G community since 2019, which has proven itself an inspiring space to grow in.
