Since moving to Tasmania fourteen years ago I have continued to run my own consultancy DH Geodata Services compiling maps for mining, engineering and environmental companies both in Australia and overseas. I am a retired Spatial Science Teacher from TafeNSW.  I have run courses using QGIS for the SSSI (now GCA) and for commercial operations with Alex Leith.
I attended the first FOSS4G SotM Oceania conference in Melbourne back in 2018 and have attended every year (except 2022 in Fiji) since then.  During COVID I organised the Hobart Hub for 2020 and 2021. I use QGIS software with two volunteer organisations who would not have a mapping capability otherwise.`,
