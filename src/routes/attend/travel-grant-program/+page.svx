## About the TGP

The Oceania FOSS4G Travel Grant Program initiative was established in 2018 by the OSGeo Oceania Board to facilitate accessibility and diversity at FOSS4G in Melbourne. It is funded by OSGeo Oceania, OSGeo Foundation, proceeds from our generous sponsors, and contributions from organisations and individuals. Please note that the number of grants available is dependent on this funding and the number of applications we receive.

The TGP is managed by the FOSS4G 2025 LOC Committee, in collaboration with the OSGeo Oceania Board. For more information, either on the disbursement of grants or guidance on the application process, please email us at tgp@foss4g.org and we will do our best to assist and accommodate you.
