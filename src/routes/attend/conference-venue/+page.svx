            Providing a child-friendly conference offers a win-win situation for attendees at FOSS4G Auckland 2025. Parents can focus on the conference content knowing their children are safe and engaged in age-appropriate activities. We feel this will lead to increased participation and higher satisfaction. It also demonstrates the conference's commitment to diversity and inclusion, attracting a wider range of professionals.
