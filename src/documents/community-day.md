# Community Day

FOSS4G conferences have a tradition of hosting a community day/code sprint after the conference. State of the Map conferences have similar traditions, often including an OpenStreetMap mapathon. Our community day is open to everyone from novice to expert. It is a melting pot of ideas where project insiders meet users and each helps the other. There's always plenty to do – it's not only about programming and/or street-mapping.

This year, **Community Day** is on **_Friday 9th November_** and activities run from 9am through to 4pm.

Registration at the conference is not a prerequisite for participation in the Community Day. Participation in the Community Day is free of charge and all folks interested in giving back to geospatial open source and open data communities are welcome.

We will base the hackathons, mapathons, and working groups at C3 Conference Venue. There are also some active options as well, where we can meet at C3 Conference Venue so you have somewhere to store your bags if you are travelling out later that day.


### But it doesn't stop there!

If you have an idea that you would like to have the community engage in with you, you are welcome to propose it at any time leading up to, and throughout the conference. Let us know so we can support you in logistics and getting the message out there email us at <program@foss4g-oceania.org>.


#### How is the Community Day (Friday 9th Nov 2024) different from the Workshop Day (Tuesday 5th Nov 2024)?

The **Community Day** is a free, informal event led by participants with shared interests in a particular topic. The emphasis of the day is to give inspired individuals a chance to meet and share their open geospatial knowledge, such as sharing code, troubleshooting problems, helping beginners tackle problems they have encountered or just bonding through adventure.

**Workshops** are structured events led by one or more instructors to learn specific tasks or to teach specific skills. Workshops require registration and cost to attend. There is a limited number of places for each workshop. Community day is open to all.


## Community Day Activities

### Adventures

#### Kunanyi-Mt Wellington Geological Field Trip

Meet at the C3 Convention Centre at 10am.  

For those interested in spending a few hours on Tasmania's most visited  tourist destination and on Hobart's back door, local geologist Colin  Mazengarb, will lead a trip up the mountain. Colin has mapped the  geology and geomorphology of the mountain with a focus  on natural hazards, particularly debris flow and rockfall processes and  he will outline these during the trip. In addition, the view of the city and surrounds are spectacular and the alpine flora quite unique in Australia.

**Fitness level:** a high level of mobility to be able to walk down stairs and on uneven ground. There is also a lower level mobility hike around the beautiful springs, but you will still get to experience the peak before you head to the springs. 

The trip can be varied depending on walking ability and weather conditions on the day. If too inclement, we will trek around the springs. 

**What to bring:**
\- Make sure you wear layers that will give you comfort as the temperature up on top of the mountain is usually 10°C than in the Hobart CBD. Pack for wind, rain and sun! 
\- Sturdy walking shoes
\- Sunscreen
\- Water
\- Snacks
\- Lunch - or you can purchase at the C3 cafe before we leave or have lunch at the cafe on the mountain.

Come and join us for the Data Cube Hack Day! If you don’t know about it, we will introduce you to it!

The Open Data Cube -[ODC](https://www.opendatacube.org/)- is a free, open-source software package that simplifies the management and analysis of large amounts of satellite imagery and other Earth observation data. It allows users to easily access, process, and analyze decades of geographical data to track changes on Earth's surface over time. ODC is designed to help scientists, researchers, and government agencies make better-informed decisions in areas such as environmental issues, land use, and resource management.

**What to bring:**

- Your own laptop
